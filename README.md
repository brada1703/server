**_What is a server?_**



*   A server is a piece of software or hardware or both that receive and respond to requests over a network. 
*   In general, servers are used to manage network resources. They can be used to store files such as images and videos as well as host websites and databases.
*   In terms of web servers, the web server will host the files used to make the website so that when a browser makes an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request, the webserver can deliver this content to the user via an HTTP response.

**_Why do we need servers?_**



*   As web developers, we need servers for several reasons. At the basic level, a static web server suffices to host a static web-page, which is served “as-is.”
*   On the other hand, a dynamic web server has the application server as well as a database, which allows it to process content and can generate pages. This type of server can be used to store information from user interactions, which can be used later on.

**_Benefits of a server_**

*   Always on
*   Always connected to the Internet
*   Same IP
*   Maintained by 3rd party
